## What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or "class". It's a protective wrapper that prevents the data from being accessed and modified by code outside the class.

The primary goal of encapsulation is **data hiding**. By making the data members of a class `private`, we prevent external code from directly manipulating them. Instead, we provide `public` methods, known as **getters and setters**, which allow controlled access to that data.
