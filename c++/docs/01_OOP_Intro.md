## What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

## Why is OOP Necessary?

OOP offers several benefits, including:

- **Modularity:** Objects create self-contained units, making code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Reusability:** Code can be reused through inheritance and composition, reducing redundancy.
- **Flexibility (Polymorphism):** Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, enabling more flexible and extensible code.
- **Data Hiding (Encapsulation):** Protects data from accidental modification by restricting direct access, improving security and integrity.
- **Easier Debugging:** Encapsulation helps in isolating issues, making debugging more straightforward.

## Pillars of OOP

Object-Oriented Programming is built on four main principles, often called the pillars of OOP. In this chapter, we will focus on **Encapsulation**. The other pillars—Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism—will be covered in upcoming chapters.

1.  **Encapsulation**: This is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components.
2.  **Abstraction**: To be covered in an upcoming chapter.
3.  **Inheritance**: To be covered in an upcoming chapter.
4.  **Polymorphism**: To be covered in an upcoming chapter.
