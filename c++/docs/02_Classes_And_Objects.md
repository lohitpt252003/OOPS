## What is a Class?

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a **class** is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a common structure and behavior that all objects of that type will possess.

## What is an Object?

An **object** is a physical instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created based on the class's blueprint.

## C++ Class Syntax Details

In C++, a class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`. It's important to end the class definition with a semicolon `;`.

**Key Points for C++:**
*   **`class ClassName { ... };`**: Defines the class.
*   **Access Specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)**: Control the visibility and accessibility of class members. By default, members are `private`.
*   **Constructor**: A method with the same name as the class, used to initialize objects.
*   **`main()` function**: Where the program execution begins and objects are typically created and used.
