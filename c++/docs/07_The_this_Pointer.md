## The `this` Pointer

In C++, `this` is a keyword that represents a pointer to the current object. It is an implicit parameter to all non-static member functions.

-   **What is `this`?** It's a pointer that holds the memory address of the object on which the member function is called.
-   **When is it used?** It is commonly used to distinguish between member variables and parameters with the same name, or to return the current object from a member function.
