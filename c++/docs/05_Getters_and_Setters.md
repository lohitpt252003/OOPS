## Getters and Setters

Getters and setters are methods used to retrieve (get) and update (set) the values of private class attributes. They provide a layer of abstraction and control over how an object's data is accessed and modified.

-   **Getters (Accessors)**: Methods that return the value of a private attribute.
-   **Setters (Mutators)**: Methods that set the value of a private attribute and can include validation logic.
