# OOPS Project

This project is dedicated to exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts across various languages, including Python, C++, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `c++`: Contains examples and implementations of OOP concepts in C++. The [C++ README](./c++/README.md) provides detailed explanations of concepts like Encapsulation, Constructors, and Destructors.
- `javascript`: Contains examples and implementations of OOP concepts in JavaScript. The [JavaScript README](./javascript/README.md) covers the same OOP concepts, highlighting differences like the use of garbage collection instead of destructors.
- `python`: Contains examples and implementations of OOP concepts in Python. The [Python README](./python/README.md) explains Python's approach to OOP, including its use of `self`, the `__init__` constructor, and the `__del__` destructor.
