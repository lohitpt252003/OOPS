## What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or "class". It's a protective wrapper that prevents the data from being accessed and modified by code outside the class.

The primary goal of encapsulation is **data hiding**. In Python, we use naming conventions (single `_` for protected and double `__` for private) to indicate that certain attributes should not be accessed directly.
