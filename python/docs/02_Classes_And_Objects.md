## What is a Class?

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a **class** is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a common structure and behavior that all objects of that type will possess.

## What is an Object?

An **object** is a physical instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created based on the class's blueprint.

## Python Class Syntax Details

In Python, a class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a colon `:`. Indentation defines the class body.

**Key Points for Python:**
*   **`class ClassName:`**: Defines the class.
*   **`__init__(self, ...)`**: The constructor method, automatically called when a new object is created.
*   **`self` parameter**: Must be the first parameter of any instance method, referring to the instance itself.
*   **No strict access modifiers**: Python uses naming conventions for "private" members, but they are not strictly enforced.
