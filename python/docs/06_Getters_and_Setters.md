## Getters and Setters

In Python, getters and setters are used to control access to attributes. The Pythonic way to implement them is by using the `@property` decorator.

-   **Getter**: The method that gets the value of an attribute is decorated with `@property`.
-   **Setter**: The method that sets the value of an attribute is decorated with `@<attribute_name>.setter`.
