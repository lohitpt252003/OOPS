## The `self` Parameter

In Python, `self` is the first parameter of any instance method. It refers to the instance of the class itself. It is a convention, not a keyword, but it is universally used and expected.

-   **What is `self`?** It's a reference to the instance of the class on which the method is called. It allows methods to access the attributes and other methods of that instance.
-   **When is it used?** It is used to access instance variables and call other instance methods.
