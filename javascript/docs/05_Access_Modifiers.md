## Access Modifiers in JavaScript

JavaScript, traditionally, did not have built-in access modifiers like `public`, `private`, or `protected`. Encapsulation was achieved through conventions and closures. However, modern JavaScript (ES2022) has introduced a syntax for true private class members.

1.  **Public**: By default, all members (properties and methods) of a JavaScript class are public. They can be accessed from anywhere.
2.  **Private (Convention)**: A common convention is to prefix a member's name with an underscore (`_`) to indicate that it is intended for internal use and should not be accessed from outside the class. However, this is just a hint for developers, and it doesn't prevent access.
3.  **Private (Modern Syntax)**: The `#` prefix (hash) is used to declare true private class members. These members are only accessible from within the class and are completely hidden from the outside. Attempting to access a private member from outside the class will result in a `SyntaxError`.

### A Note on Access Modifier Order

Unlike in C++, the concept of ordering or grouping members under `public` or `private` blocks does not apply to JavaScript. In JavaScript, visibility is determined on a per-member basis by the presence or absence of the `#` prefix. The order of definition does not affect accessibility.
