## Destructors and Garbage Collection

JavaScript does not have destructors in the same way as languages like C++ or Python. The concept of manually destroying an object or having a specific function that runs upon destruction does not exist.

-   **No Destructor Function**: You cannot define a `destructor()` or `__del__()` method that is guaranteed to run when an object is no longer in use.
-   **Automatic Garbage Collection**: Memory management is handled automatically by the JavaScript engine's garbage collector (GC). The GC's job is to identify and reclaim memory that is no longer reachable by any part of the program.
-   **Unpredictable Timing**: You cannot predict *when* the garbage collector will run. It might run frequently or very rarely, depending on memory pressure and the engine's algorithm. Therefore, you should never rely on it for timely cleanup of resources like files or network connections.

For advanced and specific use cases, the `FinalizationRegistry` object provides a way to request a cleanup callback when an object is garbage-collected. However, its use is complex, and its behavior is not guaranteed, so it is not recommended for general use.
