## What is a Class?

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a **class** is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a common structure and behavior that all objects of that type will possess.

## What is an Object?

An **object** is a physical instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created based on the class's blueprint.

## JavaScript Class Syntax Details

JavaScript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance. They are defined using the `class` keyword.

**Key Points for JavaScript:**
*   **`class ClassName { ... }`**: Defines the class.
*   **`constructor()`**: A special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class.
*   **`this` keyword**: Refers to the current instance of the class.
*   **No explicit access modifiers**: By convention, properties intended to be private might be prefixed with `_`, but they are still technically accessible.
