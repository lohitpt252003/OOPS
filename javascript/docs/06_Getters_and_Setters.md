## Getters and Setters

In JavaScript, getters and setters provide a way to get and set the values of an object's properties, while allowing for more control over how the properties are accessed and modified. They are defined using the `get` and `set` keywords.

-   **Getters**: A getter is a method that gets the value of a specific property.
-   **Setters**: A setter is a method that sets the value of a specific property. Setters can include validation logic.
